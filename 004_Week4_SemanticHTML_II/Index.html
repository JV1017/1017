        <h2>Game of Thrones</h2>
    </header>

        <h3>Who Will Win it ALL!</h3>
        <p1>We've had nearly 20 months since its Season Seven finale to contemplate how Game of Thrones will end. That's enough time to, without sleep, watch the entire series about 212 times through. And, judging by the depth of analysis that fans put into this show, it's easy to imagine that some people have watched Game of Thrones that much.
            As such, Game of Thrones has never been far from mind over the last year and seven months. Fans have been active on Reddit and elsewhere, coming up with new clues and details through re-watches that could come back in Game of Thrones Season Eight.
            Leading up to Game of Thrones Season Eight, we've spent nearly two years following the deep dives, rumors, and spoilers to compile and ultimate list of the 30 most important fan theories for the final season.</p1>

        <h3>Queen Daenerys</h3>
        <p2>Daenerys Targaryen: The good guys on Game of Thrones wouldn’t be alive without her, but now they’re wondering if they can’t live with her, either. Sunday night’s “The Last of the Starks” devoted much of its run time to what’s quickly become the fundamental question of the show’s endgame: Is Daenerys truly the best choice to rule the Seven Kingdoms, or will she follow the path set by her father and tumble into madness and tyranny?
            The issue has divided GOT fans like nothing else. Dany has been one of Thrones’ most sympathetic protagonists since the very first episode, and viewers have been with her through almost every sort of trial imaginable. Considering everything else she’s accomplished — birthing dragons out of stone, freeing thousands of slaves, helping the Starks defeat an army of ice-zombies — it’s only reasonable to root for her to end up on top. Yet in recent seasons, Daenerys has often been focused more on the “I, Me, Mine” of it all, rather than what she would use the Iron Throne to do.</p2>

        <h3>Queen Cersei</h3>
        <p3>As Game of Thrones marches toward its endgame, Cersei Lannister’s plan to “protect” the civilians of King’s Landing by securing them in the Red Keep to prevent Daenerys Targaryen from attacking her is a brilliant move: It ensures that Dany can’t win the Iron Throne without mass casualties, and in turn brings to mind Daenerys’s father, Aerys II Targaryen, and his legacy of madness and death. It’s a legacy that has haunted Daenerys and the Targaryens and one she’s been actively trying to avoid falling victim to.</p3>
